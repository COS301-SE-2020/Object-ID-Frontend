# Object-ID Frontend
Ctrl + Intelligence - This is the UI for Object-ID. The project is based on creating a system that is able to identify vehicles via their colour and number plate or registration number as well as identify any blemishes or damage to the vehicle using camera tracking software for crime prevention purposes. The system will be able to track the movements of vehicles as well as damage that occurs or is already present on the vehicle.  The system should be able to discover blemishes on the vehicle as well, such as stickers that are on the windows of the vehicle. The system will also attempt to identify the make of the vehicle in order to better track if there are stolen number plates. I.e if the vehicle has number plate x as a blue Ford and another vehicle that is a red Ferrari that also has number plate x then the system can identify this as an abnormality and report it. The system will later on be able to identify different objects as well.
